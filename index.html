            <p class="head">One cannot communicate <span class="welsh">hunaniaeth</span>, identity, without a language in which to do so. This dictionary seeks to address the lack of a Welsh feminist vocabulary, proposing alternative uses of the Welsh language which allow for expression beyond a binary of male/female, and for the articulation of a uniquely Welsh feminist identity, so that everyone, and not just their fathers, may <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref0"><em>find themselves</em> in the Welsh language</span>. One might term this language ‘<span class="welsh reference" data-ref=".ref1">hunaniaith</span>’: a language of self which allows for the articulation of all identities through the medium of the Welsh language.</p>

            <p>The opening line of the Welsh national anthem can be understood as implying that ‘my fathers’ are one and the same as the celebrated ‘poets and singers’ and singers of Wales, placing Welsh men in the position of the producers and users of the Welsh language. ‘Land of my fathers’ evokes a male genealogy: ‘<em>of</em> my fathers,’ as ‘<em>of</em> poets and singers’ can be read as implying not only that the land has produced these patriarchal linguists, but that the land (and its language) belongs to them, and will continue to do so, through a patrilineal inheritance.</p>

                <br>[T]ranslation […] ultimately serves the purpose of expressing the central reciprocal relationship between languages.</p>
            <p>The relationship between the words ‘Feminism’ and ‘<span class="welsh">Ffeministiaeth</span>’ is not reciprocal. ‘<span class="welsh">Ffeministiaeth</span>’ is not a <em>translation</em> of ‘Feminist,’ an act of cultural exchange, but rather a Welsh adoption of the English word. The practice of adopting English words to the context of Welsh liberation movements such a feminism can be understood as perpetuating colonial structures.</p>

It makes them see their past as a wasteland of non-achievement and it makes them want to identify with that which is furthest from that wasteland. It makes them want to identify with that which is furthest removed from themselves; for instance, with other peoples’ languages rather than their own.</p>
            <p>The derivation of the language of liberation from the language of the coloniser can be understood as positing the colonising language (in this case, English) as a superior language of progression.

            <p class="qv"><a href="#rhyw1">See ‘<span class="welsh">Rhyw</span> (1)’</a></p>
            <p>Welsh singular pronouns, much like English singular pronouns, reflect the ‘two categories’ of ‘male’ and ‘female’ set out in ‘<span class="welsh">Rhyw</span> (1)’: ‘<span class="welsh">Hi</span>’ (‘She’) and ‘<span class="welsh">Ef, Fe, E</span>’ (‘Him’). There is no direct translation of the English ‘It’, a <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref9">‘third person singular neuter pronoun’</span> in the Welsh language. Rather, ‘<span class="welsh">Hi</span>’ or ‘<span class="welsh">Ef</span>’ is used, depending on the grammatical gender of the object referred to.</p>
            <p class="qv"><a href="#rhyw2">See ‘<span class="welsh">Rhyw</span> (2)’</a></p>
            <p>This two gender system of categorisation can be seen as excluding people who identity neither as a man nor as a woman, or not as exclusively a man or a woman, from both the English and the Welsh language. In order to negate this exclusion, the use of the English pronouns ‘They, Them’ not only when referring to a group, or to an individual whose gender is not known to the speaker/ writer, but as a pronoun chosen by an individual to represent themselves, has become increasingly widespread. This allows for the articulation of non-binary gender identities. (<span class="welsh">Hunaniaith</span>) The American Dialect Society named ‘they’ as their 2015 word of the year:</p>
            <p class="yq"><span>2016</span> <strong>American Dialect Society, <em>2015 Word of the Year is Singular “They”</em>:</strong>
                <br><em>They</em> was recognized by the society for its emerging use as a pronoun to refer to a known person, often as a conscious choice by a person rejecting the traditional gender binary of <em>he</em> and <em>she</em>.</p>
            <p class="qv"><a href="#mutation2">See ‘Mutation (2)’</a></p>
            <p>The use of a single personal pronoun to address both a group of people and an individual is well established within the Welsh language. The English ‘You’ translates, in Welsh, as ‘<span class="welsh">Ti</span>’ or ‘<span class="welsh">Chi/Chwi</span>’. Whilst ‘<span class="welsh">Ti</span>’ always refers to an individual, ‘<span class="welsh">Chi/Chwi</span>,’ can be used either to address more than one person, or, when addressing an individual, as a ‘mark of respect of deference to the person addressed’. <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref10"><span class="welsh"><em>Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymraeg</em></span> cites such uses of ‘<span class="welsh">Chwi</span>’ as early as c. 1400-1500</span>. Given the precedent, the Welsh ‘<span class="welsh">Nhw</span>’ (They, Them), conventionally used to refer to a group, could be used in a similar way to its English counterparts, as a gender-neutral pronoun referring to an individual. (<span class="welsh">Hunaniaith</span>).</p>
            <p class="qv"><a href="#rhyw3">See ‘<span class="welsh">Rhyw</span> (3)’</a></p>
            <p>Possessive determiners in the Welsh language are also gendered. Although in isolation the possessive ‘<span class="welsh">ei</span>’ (his/her) appears gender-neutral, it causes a mutation in certain nouns it may precede, according to the gender of the person in question.</p>
            <p class="qv"><a href="#mutation3">See ‘Mutation (3)’</a></p>
            <p>Mutations do not affect vowels, and affect only the consonants <span class="welsh">‘c’, ‘p’, ‘t’, ‘g’ , ‘b’, ‘d’, <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref11">‘ll’, ‘rh’,</span></span> and <span class="welsh">‘m’</span>. There are three forms of mutation: <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref12">‘Soft’, ‘Aspirate’, and ‘Nasal’</span>. ‘<span class="welsh">Ei</span>’ (‘His’) causes a Soft Mutation, which creates <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref13">the following phonological and written changes:</span></p>
            <p><span class="welsh">c > g
                <br/> p > b
                <br/> t > d
                <br/> b > f
                <br/> d > dd
                <br/> ll > l
                <br/> rh > r
                <br/> m > f</span> </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> his tradition <span class="welsh">&bull; ei draddodiad. ‘Traddodiad</span>’ mutates.</p>
            <p>‘<span class="welsh">Ei</span>’ (her) causes Aspirate Mutation, which creates <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref14">the following changes:</span></p>
            <p><span class="welsh">c > ch
                <br/>p > ph
                <br/>t > th

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> her tradition &bull; <span class="welsh">ei thraddodiad. ‘Traddodiad</span>’ mutates.</p>
            <p>To designate either soft or aspirate mutation as gender-neutral would be to posit either masculinity or femininity as universal. However, to abolish these mutations would be to disregard a pattern of mutation which is deeply ingrained in the Welsh language.</p>
            <p class="yq"><span>1993</span> <strong>Gareth King, <em>Modern Welsh: A Comprehensive Grammar</em>, p.3:</strong>
                <br>[mutation] pervade[s] the entire structure of the language, and cannot be divorced from any aspect of it.</p>
            <p>Given the aforementioned tradition of using a single pronoun to refer to both a group and an individual, the same pattern could be introduced with regards to possessive pronouns. The plural possessive pronoun ‘<span class="welsh">Eu</span>’ (their), which does not cause a mutation but has an identical pronunciation to ‘<span class="welsh">Ei</span>’, could thus be used as a gender-neutral singular possessive pronoun. (<span class="welsh">Hunaniaith</span>)</p>

            <p class="ss">2) Welsh identity &bull; <span class="welsh">hunaniaeth Cymraeg</span>.</p>
            <p class="qv"><a href="#rhyw4">See ‘<span class="welsh">Rhyw</span> (4)’</a></p>
            <p>To be a Welsh person is to be a ‘<span class="welsh">Cymraes</span>’, a female Welsh person, or a ‘<span class="welsh">Cymro</span>,’ a male Welsh person. This again can be understood as enforcing a two-gender model, which does not allow for the articulation of a specifically Welsh non-binary gender identity.</p>
            <p>This binarisation of identity is not an issue unique to Welsh culture. Latin-Americans have introduced the word ‘Latinx’ in order to negate the gendering of Latin-American identity that occurs in the use of the words ‘Latina’ (Latin-American woman, ‘Latin’ + ‘a’, a feminine suffix) or ‘Latino’ (Latin-American man, ‘Latin’ + ‘a’, a masculine suffix). ‘Latino’ is also often used as a universal descriptor for Latin-Americans, as is evident in the OED definition:</p>
            <p class="bq"><em>Latino, n.: A Latin-American inhabitant of the United States.</em></p>
            <p>Raquel Reichard notes that ‘Latin@’ has previously been used as a universal term for Latin-American in order to include both masculine and feminine identities, the shape of the symbol ‘@’ resembling both ‘a’ and and ‘o’. ‘Latinx’, Reichaird argues, moves beyond the inclusion of feminine identity, the ‘x’ not only rendering the masculine ‘Latino’ gender-neutral, but also ‘encompass[ing] genders outside of that limiting man-woman binary.’</p>
            <p class="yq"><span>2015</span><strong>Raquel Reichard, <em>Latina</em>:</strong>
                <br>Latinx, […] includes the numerous people of Latin American descent whose gender identities fluctuate along different points of the spectrum, from agender or nonbinary to gender non-conforming, genderqueer and genderfluid, rather than Latina/Latino.</p>
            <p>This model is not directly applicable to the Welsh <span class="welsh">‘Cymro’/‘Cymraes’</span>, as the letter ‘X’ does not exist in the Welsh alphabet. The word ‘<span class="welsh">Cymrx</span>’ could thus, as ‘<span class="welsh">ffeministiaeth</span>,’ be regarded as imposing a feature of the language of the coloniser upon the language of the colonised in order to perform cultural progression.</p>
            <p class="yq"><span>1986</span><strong>Nguigi wa Thiong’o, <em>Decolonising the Mind</em>:</strong>
                <br>to control a people’s culture is to control their tools of self-definition in relationship to others.</p>
            <p>Using a word which usually indicates a group as a gender-neutral word for an individual, such as ‘<span class="welsh">Nhw</span>’ and ‘<span class="welsh">Eu</span>’, is also problematic in the case of Welsh identity. The collective term for the Welsh people is ‘<span class="welsh">Cymry</span>’ (as opposed to the geographical name for the country of Wales, ‘<span class="welsh">Cymru</span>’). <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref15">John Davies writes that this word descends from the Brythonic ‘<span class="welsh">combriogi</span>’, meaning ‘fellow-countrymen’</span>. This term thus posits the masculine as universal, implicitly reinforcing a patrilineal or even ‘fratrilineal’ image of Welsh identity.</p>
            <p>The Welsh suffix ‘<span class="welsh">ydd</span>’ is both a pluralising suffix, as in ‘<span class="welsh">ieithydd</span>’ (languages), and designates an individual who does the verb it follows, as in <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref16">‘<span class="welsh">cyfieithydd</span>’, ‘translator’ (‘<span class="welsh">Cyfieuthi</span>’, ‘translate’ + ‘<span class="welsh">ydd</span>’), and ‘<span class="welsh">ysgrifennydd</span>’, ‘writer’ (‘<span class="welsh">ysgrifennu</span>’, ‘write’ + ‘<span class="welsh">ydd</span>’)</span>. ‘<span class="welsh">Ydd</span>’ can also designate one who follows an ideology, such as ‘<span class="welsh">Benywdd</span>’, ‘Feminist’. ‘<span class="welsh">Ydd</span>’ is thus a gender-neutral alternative to the suffixes ‘<span class="welsh">es</span>’ (which marks femaleness) and ‘<span class="welsh">wr</span>’ (which mark maleness, but is often used as universal or if the gender of the person completing the action is not known.)</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> ‘<span class="welsh">Canwr</span>’ (singer, male singer), ‘<span class="welsh">Cantores</span>’ (female singer)</p>
            <p><em>Gwlad beirdd a chantorion…</em></p>
            <p>‘<span class="welsh">Cymrydd</span>’ could thus designate an individual who <em>does Welsh</em>.</p>

            <p>Crenshaw asserts that although she coined the term in the 1980s, the ideas it articulates are not new; rather the metaphor of intersectionality makes visible convergences that are often unacknowledged within liberation movements.</p>
            <p class="yq"><span>2014</span><strong>Kimberlé Crenshaw, <em>New Statesman</em>:</strong>
                <br>Intersectionality draws attention to invisibilities that exist in feminism, in anti-racism, in class politics.</p>
            <p>At present, words equivalent to ‘Intersectional’ and ‘Intersectionality’ in the Welsh language do not exist. The Welsh translation of ‘Intersectional’, the adjective describing identities existing at the intersection of axes, could be ‘<span class="welsh">Croestoriadol</span>’- ‘an intersection’ + ‘<span class="welsh">ol</span>’ (‘al’) – or ‘<span class="welsh">Croestorriol</span>’ – ‘to intersect’ + ‘<span class="welsh">ol</span>’. The Welsh term for ‘Intersectionality’, the overarching metaphor, would thus be ‘<span class="welsh">Croestoriadolaidd</span>’ or ‘<span class="welsh">Croestorriolaidd</span>’ – ‘<span class="welsh">Crosetoriadol</span>’ or ‘<span class="welsh">Croestorriol</span>’ + ‘<span class="welsh">iaidd</span>’ (a suffix which creates an adjective when following a noun or verb.)</p>

            <p>‘<span class="welsh">Dynes</span>’ designates ‘Woman’ as an altered version of the prototype human ‘Man’. ‘<span class="welsh">Gwraig</span>’, ‘<span class="welsh">Mun</span>’ and ‘<span class="welsh">Merch</span>’ indicate a woman’s sexual experience, and her relationship to a man, by designating her as ‘of’, belonging to, a man (as a daughter or as a sexual/romantic partner). ‘<span class="welsh">Benyw</span>’ comparatively allows ‘woman’ individual autonomy, and is thus perhaps the most appropriate word from which to draw a Welsh term for ‘Feminism’ as a movement.</p>
            <p>‘Feminism’ shares the Latin root ‘Fēmina’ with ‘Feminine’. A feminism which aims to deconstruct gender binaries is perhaps equally as concerned with the concept of ‘Femininity’ as it is with the concept of ‘Woman’: with the lower ranking of femininity in an enforced hierarchy of behaviour, and the way in which patriarchy requires bodies read as female to perform femininity, whilst others are barred from it. ‘<span class="welsh">Benyw</span>’ encompasses this duality. ‘Femininity’, in Welsh, translates as ‘<span class="welsh">Benywaeth</span>’ or ‘<span class="welsh">Benywiaeth</span>’: ‘<span class="welsh">Benyw</span>’ + ‘<span class="welsh">aeth</span>’ or ‘<span class="welsh">iaeth</span>’ (‘ism’). ‘<span class="welsh">Benyw</span>’ is also the root of ‘<span class="welsh">Benywydd</span>’, which (alongside ‘<span class="welsh">Ffeminist</span>’) denotes the individual ‘Feminist’: <span class="welsh">Benyw</span> + <span class="welsh">ydd</span> (ist). ‘<span class="welsh">Benywddiaeth</span>’ could thus be an alternative term for ‘Feminism’ which is rooted in the Welsh language.</p>

            <p class="ss">1) The Rebecca Riots:</p>
            <p>In 1847, an inquiry into the state of education in Wales was commissioned as a response to a period of political unrest in Wales. This period was characterised by movements such as <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref27">the Rebecca Riots</span>. <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref28">Rhian E. Jones writes</span> that the movement, which she terms ‘Rebeccaism’, though largely known for its ‘attacks on toll gates’ also encompassed ‘protest against high rents, tithes, evictions, workhouses and the New Poor Law,’ with the protest taking ‘forms ranging from property damage to threatening letters and mass demonstrations.’</p>
            <p class="qv"><a href="#mutation1">See ‘Mutation (1)’</a></p>
            <p>Rebeccaism is notable for the use of costume by protestors. Jones notes that Rebeccaism has been consistently portrayed by historians and within Welsh mythology as a movement in which men assumed female dress <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref29">for the practical purpose of disguise</span>. Jones, however, asserts the importance of a previously largely unacknowledged component of the movement: <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref30">‘Rebeccaite dress contained a deliberate mixture of masculine and feminine signifiers’</span>. The (predominantly male) protestors wore not only clothing associated with femaleness, but donned also false beards, markers of maleness. Jones argues that the <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref31">‘performance of stylised elderly and matriarchal virtues also heightened the contrast with the actual qualities of the ‘actor’’</span>, the male protestor. Rebeccaism also transgressed the male/female binary in its adoption of a matriarchal figure as its namesake.</p>
            <p class="bq"><span class="reference" data-ref=".ref32">And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.</span></p>
            <p>The protestors acted as ‘Rebecca and her daughters’, embodying a matrilineal heritage of Welsh working class dissent which utilised the transgression of a male/female gender binary in order to <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref33">challenge economic disparity</span>.</p>
            <p class="bq"><span class="welsh">Mae hen wlad fy nhadau yn annwyl i mi…</span></p>
            <hr>
            <p class="ss">2) The Treachery of the Blue Books:</p>
            <p>The inquiry into the state of education in Wales concluded that an English language education would provide a solution to Welsh political unrest, as well as to widespread poverty. Gwyneth Tyson Roberts writes that in order to arrive at this conclusion, the commissioners had to establish a linguistic hierarchy which appeared to be incontrovertible: <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref34">‘the political dangers of inadequate education and widespread Welsh ignorance of English, the imperial language, had to be presented as objective and indisputable facts’</span>.</p>
            <p>Jane Williams, writing under the bardic name ‘Ysgafell’, published in 1848 a series of Rem<em>arks on Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the State of Education in Wales</em>. Williams writes: <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref35">‘the whole aggregate of imputed enormities is traced […] to one origin, their [the Welsh working class] ignorance of the English language’</span>. However, the commissioners not only allocate blame for Welsh immorality and poverty to Welsh ignorance of the English language, but imply that the origin of these ‘enormities’ is the Welsh language itself. The commissioner Jellynger C. Symons writes:</p>
            <p class="bq"><span class="reference" data-ref=".ref36">The Welsh language is a vast drawback to Wales, and a manifold barrier to the moral progress and commercial prosperity of its people. It is not easy to over-estimate its evil effects. […] It dissevers the people from intercourse which would help advance their civilization, and bars the access of improving knowledge to their minds. As proof of this, there is no Welsh literature worth of the name.</span></p>
            <p class="bq"><span class="welsh">Gwlad beirdd a chantorion…</span></p>
            <p>The commissioners portray the Welsh language as an active agent, an aggressor, barring the Welsh working class from economic or cultural progression, whilst the speakers of Welsh are portrayed as passive, acted upon by their language. The image of the Welsh language as an obstruction is repeated throughout the Reports. Welsh is described as <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref37">‘a peculiar language isolating the mass from the upper portion of society’</span>, the Welsh speaker as disconnected: <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref38">‘his language keeps him under the hatches, being one in which he can neither acquire nor communicate the necessary information’</span>. These statements do not simply suggest that a lack of English language education inhibits communication, but also that regardless of their potential acquisition of English as a second language, Welsh speakers are restricted by the very fact of their speaking Welsh. It is this demonisation of the Welsh language that earned the Reports the name, in Wales, of ‘<span class="welsh">Brad Y Llyfr Gleision</span>’ or ‘Treachery of the Blue Books.’</p>
            <p><span class="reference" data-ref=".ref39">Tyson Roberts notes</span> that the commissioners deemed ‘immoral’ ‘aspects of physicality which contravened middle-class Victorian rules for acceptable behaviour’, many of which ‘are more closely related to the poverty of a working-class population than they are with any specifically Welsh characteristics’. The report in particular scrutinises the sexual behaviour of Welsh women. The commissioners write that sexual intercourse outside of marriage is common in Wales, noting specifically the Welsh practice of ‘<span class="welsh">caru yn/ar y gwely</span>’ (loving in/on the bed), in which unmarried couples would spend time alone in the bedroom of the female partner, a practice which existed in part because working class couples would often have to wait a considerable amount of time <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref40">before they could afford to marry</span>. Tyson Roberts notes that despite the fact that the relations reported upon are solely heterosexual, the <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref41">‘blame for infringements of the strict moral code that forbade sex before marriage is assumed in the Report (as in most Victorian public pronouncements) to rest exclusively on the shoulders of women’</span>.</p>
            <p>The commissioners locate responsibility for the moral health of Wales with Welsh women, writing that <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref42">‘each generation will derive its moral tone in a great degree from the influences imparted by the mothers who reared them’</span>.</p>
            <p class="bq"><span class="welsh">Mae hen wlad fy nhadau…</span></p>
            <p>The commissioners often neglect to report on the state of education for Welsh girls. Tyson Roberts writes that their report implies that in some Welsh towns <span class="reference" data-ref=".ref43">‘there was no education provision […] for the daughter of poor parents’</span>, and that this lack of provision was considered by the commissioners to be unimportant.</p>
